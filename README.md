# 🚀 Machine Learning Practice - XGBoost Model for Vehicle Exchange Prediction

This repository contains a hands-on machine learning project using the XGBoost algorithm to predict whether a vehicle will be exchanged based on customer and vehicle attributes.

---

## 📂 Project Files

- `exchange_prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook containing all code from data loading to evaluation and feature importance.
- `exchange_dataset_enhanced.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing the model (make sure it's uploaded if you're running this locally or in the right S3 path if you're using SageMaker).

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure the following tools/libraries are available:

- Python 3.7 or above
- JupyterLab or Amazon SageMaker Studio
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `xgboost`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `joblib` (if saving model)

---

## 💻 Running the Notebook Locally (JupyterLab)

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name


##🧠 What You'll Learn
- How to train an XGBoost classifier
- Simple feature engineering techniques
- Evaluating model performance using confusion matrix and classification report
- Visualizing feature importance
- (Optionally) Saving model and predictions to AWS S3
