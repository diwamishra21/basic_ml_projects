## ðŸ“‚ Project Files

- `exchange_prediction.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook containing all code from data loading to evaluation and feature importance.
- `exchange_dataset_enhanced.csv` â€“ Dataset used for training and testing the model (make sure it's uploaded if you're running this locally or in the right S3 path if you're using SageMaker).

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure the following tools/libraries are available:

- Python 3.7 or above
- JupyterLab or Amazon SageMaker Studio
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `xgboost`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `joblib` (if saving model)
